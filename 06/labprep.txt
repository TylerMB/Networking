COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Q9: Both of the programs you will implement require you to use the command line
arguments. To get some practice with this, write a program (you donâ€™t have to compile it) which takes two arguments. The first argument should be a word and the second argument should be a number which determines how many times to print out the word

A9: 

public class PrintWord {

	public static main(String [] args){
	
		for(int i = 0; i < Integer.parseInt(args[1]; i++){
			System.out.println(args[0]);
		}

	}


}
