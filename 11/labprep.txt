1) prints a line of text to the output stream

2) the socket's output stream

3) so that the ID can be printed out when the ClientHandler object is printed.

4) no a new number is given, because the int count is incremented and used as
   the ID for the new client.

5)  lines 12->13 then 20->24

    try {
       new ChatServer().startServer(Integer.parseInt(args[0]));
        
       public void startServer(int port) throws Exception {
           ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
           System.err.println("ChatServer started");
           while(true) {
                ClientHandler ch = new ClientHandler(serverSocket.accept());

6) 3 + 3*2 + 1 = 10

7) Three ClientHandler threads send a welcome message.

   All start continious while loop which calls the sendAll method if a line is read by ChatServer.

   Three clients start two threads each one for reading and sending input to
   the server and one for reading and sending from the server to stdout. 

   The first thread starts a while loop that listens for new connections and starts all threads.
